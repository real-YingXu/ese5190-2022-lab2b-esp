##
Which parts of the lab specification have you found most confusing or difficult to understand? Be specific, and quote any parts of the lab description relevant to your answer (e.g., "modify the PIO/DMA logic analyzer example to record a timestamped trace of an RP2040-ADPS9960 exchange while the BOOT button is pressed.") I will make particular notice of anything that seems underspecified (e.g., words whose meaning is not clear from context, or conflicting interpretations of a deliverable).

I think the part8 is the most confusing to understand.
Use the capabilities of your sequencer to implement the ADPS9960 protocol and control the sensor

##

Which lab topics have you found most confusing or difficult to understand? E.g., "serial communication with Python," "aliased bitwise operations," "programming the PIO," etc. Be specific, and describe any lingering areas of confusion and/or anything that has helped you navigate them.

part 8: I don't understand how to use sequencer. 


##

Which parts of the lab have you found most difficult to implement? Again, be specific, citing any parts of the lab materials & your own code that are relevant to your answer.

Part8:I don't understand how to measure the timestamped transitions.

What steps have you taken to resolve these difficulties? Any other barriers you have faced to completing this assignment? Mention any students, repos, or other resources you have found helpful in completing the lab so far.

Yuxuan Li helped me a lot and my teammates helped me to understand every step in detail
